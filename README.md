# Particle_Swarm
Application of swarm intelligence in optimization

The code is designed to use swarm of particles to find a min or max value in a given array containing numbers.
In the given case the set of data comprises of 2D coordinates and absolute hight of a given 3D space.

This code will be further developed to facilitate classification methods based on statistical analysis in big data sets (up to 16 mln records)

The main goal of particle swarm in this case is minimizing the computational power required for the classification.
